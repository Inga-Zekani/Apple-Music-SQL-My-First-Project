# Apple-Music-SQL-My-First-Project
This project is a SQL-based data analysis project that explores user listening behavior on a synthetic Apple Music streaming dataset. The dataset was manually created for learning and portfolio purposes and does not contain any real Apple Music data. The main goal of this project is to practice SQL skills used in data analysis, including data exploration, aggregation, filtering, and trend analysis.

## MySQL

1. MySQL Workbench
2. CSV data format
3. SQL (DDL & DML)

## Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- Creating databases and tables (CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE)
- Importing CSV data into MySQL
- Data filtering using WHERE
- Aggregations using GROUP BY
- Sorting and ranking results
- Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for cleaner queries
- Basic analytical queries for insights

## Problem Statement

Raw music streaming data is often stored in CSV files, which makes it difficult to efficiently analyze user behavior, trends, and performance metrics at scale.
Without a structured database and well-written SQL queries, it is challenging to answer key analytical questions such as:

### Example Analysis Questions

1. Which songs and artists on apple music are most streamed in the top 5 and bottom 5?
2. How does listening behavior differ between Free and Premium users?
3. Which genres are most popular across different countries?
4. What trends can be observed over time?

The problem is to transform raw streaming data into a structured SQL database and use SQL queries to extract meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## Solution Approach

The data was imported into a MySQL database and analyzed using SQL queries. By structuring the data into a relational table and applying filtering, aggregation, and CTEs, meaningful insights were extracted regarding listening behavior, popular genres, and subscription patterns.
